						<p>Positive thinking sounds useful on the surface. (Most of us would prefer to be positive rather than negative.) But,
						"positive thinking‚Äù is also a soft and fluffy term that is easy to dismiss. In the real world, 
						it rarely carries the same weight as words like "work ethic" or "persistence."<br>
						Research is beginning to reveal that positive thinking is about much more than just being happy or displaying an upbeat attitude.
						Positive thoughts can actually create real value in your life and help you build skills that last much longer than a smile.</p>

				<p>Let's say that you're walking through the forest and suddenly a tiger steps onto the path ahead of you.
				When this happens, your brain registers a negative emotion - in this case, fear.<br>
				Researchers have long known that negative emotions program your brain to do a specific action. 
				hen that tiger crosses your path, for example, you run.The rest of the world doesn't matter.
				You are focused entirely on the tiger, the fear it creates, and how you can get away from it.
				In other words, negative emotions narrow your mind and focus your thoughts.<br><br>
				We hereby write and deliver these post with regular events to boost your positivity and calmness 
			    in your regular and corporate life to make decision broadly rather than some specific one.</p><!--diff in content VS <p>-->
