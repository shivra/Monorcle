				<p>Do not you like your eyes because they are not blue?
				Your mom loves them because they are like chocolate. Are your legs too long? Your best friend wants to have your legs because you are like a model. Sit for a while with people you like and who know you. Listen to them. They can be a mirror to you. They know you well.
				They can tell you why you are lovely and special.</p><!--diff in content VS <p>-->
